This is (in theory) User Documentation
======================================

Introduction
------------

This section contains documentation useful to users of the software; things like examples on how to
use the interface or how to install and compile code.

This is very different from the developer/contributor documentation, which is aimed at those that
might be writing code for the project, which will detail things like how to test or how to make
releases.

Note that the "Introduction" header will end up in the toctree of the parent document.

We'll now make our own toctree!
